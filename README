=== PSTDLIB ===

== What is it? ==

Pstdlib is an implementation of the useful parts of the C and C++ standard library, written in C++14+
Pstdlib is written for use in my homebrew OS project for 32-bit X86, paulOS

While this library will try to follow the standard libraries where possible, there will be some places where
it deviates significantly. Examples include:
 - No locale support
 - C varargs functions will be replaced with C++ variable templates.
 - C++ iostreams will not be implemented.
 - All functions are currently in the 'pstd' namespace, to ease testing.
 - static_* versions of the standard containers will be included that do not allocate, similar to
   boost::container::static_vector and friends.
 - Non-re-entrant versions of some C functions like strtok will be replaced with re-entrant versions.

== What's Implemented ==

Currently the following is implemented

 - C standard library
    - string.h (cstring.hpp): all but strtok are implemented and tested.

 - C++ Standard Library
    - type_traits (type_traits.hpp): most traits are implemented, untested.
    - iterator (iterator.hpp): most iterator support is implemented, but untested.
    - utility (utility.hpp): most things are implemented, including move, forward, and pair.
    - array (array.hpp): implemented, untested.
    - algorithm (algorithm.hpp): ~50% implemented, untested.


== Build Requirements ==

This library requires no external libraries, and no external headers except for <stdint.h> and <stddef.h>.
Therefore it should build for most platforms without issue.

== Compiler Support ==

This library has only ever been tested on GCC, and should work okay on most architectures.
